# 👋 Welcome to CoderPush

We’re a software agency that believes in building **lasting knowledge**, not just shipping code.  

Our greatest asset is our people — and their growth. We invest in tools and habits that help everyone become better collaborators, writers, and open-source contributors. GitHub isn’t just where we push code — it’s where we practice, share, and evolve together.

## 🧠 For CoderPush Team Members

👉 Our internal knowledge base lives [**HERE**](https://github.com/orgs/CoderPush/discussions)

That’s where we:
- Ask and answer questions
- Share project insights
- Document playbooks
- Run polls and get feedback
- Celebrate what we’re learning
